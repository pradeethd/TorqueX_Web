<h1>TorqueX</h1>
<h2>Enhancing Vehicle Efficiency, with Real-Time Torque Optimization</h2>

We are a team of electrical engineering students from Thiagarajar College of Engineering, Madurai, dedicated to enhancing the driving experience with our innovative solution, Torquex. This web-based platform provides real-time monitoring and control over critical vehicle parameters such as motor torque, road angle, battery State of Charge (SoC), speed, and vehicle load. <br />

By utilizing advanced sensors and algorithms, Torquex allows drivers to optimize performance, particularly during hill climbs, ensuring efficient torque distribution for a smoother, safer, and more fuel-efficient drive. Whether you're navigating steep inclines or cruising through city roads, our technology maximizes your vehicle's potential, delivering smarter performance with ease. <br />
